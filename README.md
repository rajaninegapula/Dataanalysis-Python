Instacart Grocery basket Analysis Project Data Analysis using Python.

Objective

Instacart, an online grocery platform, aims to understand customer purchasing patterns and identify insights for a more targeted marketing strategy. As part of the analytical team, I conducted an exploratory analysis to help Instacart better segment their customers and tailor marketing campaigns to specific profiles.

Key Objectives

Instacart stakeholders are particularly interested in understanding customer diversity and shopping behaviors to improve ad targeting. The analysis focuses on answering the following questions:
What are the busiest days of the week and hours of the day for orders?
Are there specific times when customers spend more money?
Can products be grouped into simpler price ranges to assist marketing?
Which product categories are most popular and drive frequent orders?

By addressing these questions through data analysis in Python, I provided insights on customer behaviors, peak shopping times, product preferences, and pricing trends. The results will help Instacart optimize ad scheduling and refine marketing strategies to enhance customer engagement.
